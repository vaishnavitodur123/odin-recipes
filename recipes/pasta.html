    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a staple food in Italian cuisine and has become popular worldwide due to its versatility, ease of
        preparation, and delicious taste. It is made from durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs to form a dough,
        which is then shaped into various forms such as spaghetti, penne, fusilli, and many others.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Step:Boiling: Fill a large pot with water, add salt, and bring it to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook
            according to package instructions or until al dente, which means the pasta is cooked through but still
            slightly firm to the bite.
        </li>
        <li>Step:Draining: Once cooked, drain the pasta in a colander, reserving some of the pasta water for sauces if
            needed.

        </li>
        <li>Step:Sauce Preparation: While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce of your choice, such as tomato-based,
            cream-based, or olive oil-based sauces, along with vegetables, meat, or seafood.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step:Combining: Return the drained pasta to the pot or mix it directly into the saucepan with the prepared
            sauce. Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step:Seasoning: Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, herbs, or grated cheese as desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
